Welcome to ButtonToy, the newest Toy from Joyleaf Corp! This is a free sample that came with one of your orders from KeyLock Stores! Push some buttons and have fun!

This toy gets your name, pronouns, and birthday from SSP Preferences.

Hotkeys:
t - talk
r - repeat what it said last
f1 - open readme (this file!)

Credits:
Zichqec and Galla made the balloon and a nice tiling pattern for the menu! I edited the color of the pattern and the balloon to fit the ghost better. I also used Zichqec's minigames code for the minigame button.
Thank you! :D

This ghost is redistributable, but don't delete anything! You can fix minor errors (typos, etc.), but be sure to add a notice that you did so in this Readme. You don't have to give me credit, but if you want to, just put this somewhere in the readme, or the page where you have it for download: Created by Odie Dog at Ladybug Lane. You can copy this as a template to make your own ghost for some reason, though, instead of the amazing one at: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html, by Zarla, or one of the templates by Zichqec, like the Simplicity Template which I used to make this ghost, which I recommend you use instead. :P
